// For correct stream execution Associative , Non Interfering , state less , no side effects 
// lambdas are must .

//1. Create streams with multiple time parallel and sequential call . 
//0. Analyze various stream methods with parallel and sequential streams . 
//1. Benchmark primitive arrays for loop with sequential and parallel streams with this array .
//2. Benchmark List<Employee> to print all employee names with for loop , 
//   with sequential and parallel streams .
//3. Check how ConcurrentHashMap gives better performance in collectors instead of HashMap and 
//   check if we can use any concurrent map which ensures order or not .
//4. Check no of threads in system common fork join pool . Increase number of threads in common pool .
//5. Use custom Fork Join pool ,
